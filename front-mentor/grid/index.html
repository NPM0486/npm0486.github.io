              " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
              I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
              The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
              hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
              next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
              often referred to it during interviews as an example of my develop
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
              after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
